Insurance cost differs from each individual, certain variable may affect a person insurance cost to be higher or lower.

This project will analyze medical insurance cost in a dataset and exploring variables that may affect it. Further, this project will showcase data analysis skills to provide meaningful insight.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about health insurance policies, coverage, premiums, and demographic details such as age, income, and region. The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned before performing the analysis.

The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. The dataset consist of 7 columns:

+ **region**: the beneficiary's residential area in the US; northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
+ **charges**: individual medical costs billed by health insurance, in USD

## Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used in this project:

+ **Python**
+ **Pandas** for data manipulation
+ **NumPy** for numerical operations
+ **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook for running the analysis interactively
